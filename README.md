# CS50x_rawru
A collection of all my projects that I made during CS50x.

For this course, I'm planning on completing the course itself with the "less comfortable" problems first.
Then, I'll do the "more comfortable" problems after completing the course.

Before starting CS50x, I already finished 2 other courses in Computer Science as required in my school's curriculum.
The courses include:
  Microsoft Excel;
  Flowchart;
  Introductory-level Python and;
  Up to Intermediate C++

So yeah, I do have some prior experience in programming. The problem sets and lab activities (so far) are quite easy to do by myself.

Though I am familiar with programming enough to learn languages on my own, I have yet to familiarize myself with tools and the like.
For example, I'm quite new to GitHub and can't seem to find how to rename a file/folder or create a new folder.
By tools... like, I just learned how to use a debugger for the first time!
Or, I have yet to wrap my mind around compilers. 
I tried installing minGW with the help of a guide in VSCode and successfully installed it. Problem is: I can't use it as well as I hoped for.
(In school, we used onlinegdb.com [sometimes], DevC++ [they recommended it but from reviews, it wasn't as good as other tools,
and I want to be able to familiarize myself with something that I will stay with for a long time], or CodeChum [our Computer Science learning platform])
(Any kind of advice would really help!)
I currently use VSCode (I'm also trying PyCharm, CLion, and Visual Studio but only PyCharm seems to work well enough with me...)

In a month or two from the time of writing this, my summer break officially ends and school starts once again.
I found this course quite a bit too late so I'll have to manage my time between school and this course.
My school... I'm not really sure if they're considerate when it comes to deadlines or it's just because of my procrastination...
I'm hoping that I won't procrastinate as much so that I can stay mentally healthy :). [Wish me good luck!]
