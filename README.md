# CS50x_rawru
A collection of all my projects that I made during CS50x.


Before starting CS50x, I already finished 2 other courses in Computer Science as required in my school's curriculum.
The courses include:
  Microsoft Excel;
  Flowchart;
  Introductory-level Python and;
  Up to Intermediate C++

So yeah, I do have some prior experience in programming. The problem sets and lab activities (so far) are quite easy to do by myself.

In a month or two from the time of writing this, my summer break officially ends and school starts once again.
I found this course quite a bit too late so I'll have to manage my time between school and this course.
My school... I'm not really sure if they're considerate when it comes to deadlines or it's just because of my procrastination...
I'm hoping that I won't procrastinate as much so that I can stay mentally healthy :). [Wish me good luck!]
